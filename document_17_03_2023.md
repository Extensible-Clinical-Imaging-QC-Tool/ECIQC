### New features by the 2022 cohort
When we took on this project, we had only a vague idea on how the pipeline actually work, and none of us had any experience working c++! A lot of ideas went around on what we should do! As time went by, with the help of Martin, Chris, Ian, Julia and Emmanuel, we had a clear road map:

> --> create a logging system for each part
> 
> --> build up the whole pipeline
>    
> --> test the whole pipeline under different cases
>    
> --> debug and improve

Now let's dive deep into each part, and see what we've already done.

#### Step1: Create a logging system

Logging is an important part in modern software engineering, and it helps us get familiar with the code. So we started with adding the logger. Martin taught us how to set up the [DCMTK logger file](./src/logging.cpp). Then we were able to set up the logger by writing
> set_root_logging("./result/pipeline_root_test.log", true);

in the [main function](./exe/qctool.cpp).
