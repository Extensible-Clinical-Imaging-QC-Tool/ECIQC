### New features by the 2022 cohort
When we took on this project, we had only a vague idea on how the pipeline actually work, and none of us had any experience working c++! A lot of ideas went around on what we should do! As time went by, with the help of Martin, Chris, Ian, Julia and Emmanuel, we had a clear road map:

> **create a logging system for each part --> build up the whole pipeline --> test the whole pipeline under different cases --> debug and improve**
