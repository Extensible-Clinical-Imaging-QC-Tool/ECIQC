Welcome to software engineering project week. This instruction gives a step-\/by-\/step introduction to the ECIQC structure with a mixture of introduction and task sheet. Please note the tasks aim to help you get some hands-\/on experience. You can skip anything if that\textquotesingle{}s too easy for you. Given the different background and expertise of group members, you are encouraged to help each other throughout the journey.

Feel free to email Yiming Wei (\href{mailto:yiming.wei@dtc.ox.ac.uk}{\texttt{ yiming.\+wei@dtc.\+ox.\+ac.\+uk}}) or Dr. Martin Robinson (\href{mailto:martin.robinson@dtc.ox.ac.uk}{\texttt{ martin.\+robinson@dtc.\+ox.\+ac.\+uk}}).\hypertarget{Introduction_autotoc_md16}{}\doxysubsubsection{Step1\+: Make sure you are a member of Extensible-\/\+Clinical-\/\+Imaging-\/\+QC-\/\+Tool}\label{Introduction_autotoc_md16}
You should have all received an invitation. If not, email Yiming or Martin.\hypertarget{Introduction_autotoc_md17}{}\doxysubsubsection{Step2\+: Git clone to your own laptop or SABS laptop.}\label{Introduction_autotoc_md17}
The ECIQC should work for both Mac\+OS and linux system. If you\textquotesingle{}re using the Windows system, install Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL). If your Windows system does not support WSL, contact Martin for a SABS laptop.\hypertarget{Introduction_autotoc_md18}{}\doxysubsubsection{Step3\+: Go through the README file in the root directory to run ECIQC locally.}\label{Introduction_autotoc_md18}
This should be quite straightforward. The DICOM images and two log files in the {\ttfamily ./result} directory indicate successful running. Read through log files to understand what\textquotesingle{}s happening.\hypertarget{Introduction_autotoc_md19}{}\doxysubsubsection{Step4\+: Get familiar with the codebase.}\label{Introduction_autotoc_md19}
\hypertarget{Introduction_autotoc_md20}{}\doxysubsubsection{Step5\+: Get familiar with DICOM format}\label{Introduction_autotoc_md20}
Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine (DICOM) is the standard for the communication and management of medical imaging information and related data. The ECIQC primarily works on DICOM images. You can encouraged to use Google/\+Chat\+GPT to learn more about the DICOM format.

All files in the {\ttfamily ./\+DICOM\+\_\+\+Images} are in the DICOM format. To play around, use Python/\+Matlab and relevant packages to read these images, understand how to get access to metadata, and try to visualise them.\hypertarget{Introduction_autotoc_md21}{}\doxysubsubsection{Step6\+: Understand how configuration files are written}\label{Introduction_autotoc_md21}
This might be tricky in the first place. Read through the tutorial and configuration gallery to see whether you can understand the general rules. Last year, we spent a long time understanding how it works from the source code. Hopefully this year you will not have this \char`\"{}painful\char`\"{} experience.

Once you are comfortable with them, try to play around to test your understanding. You can create your own configuration file and pass it into {\ttfamily pipeline\+\_\+test\+\_\+main.\+py}. You can also customise your own image by changing the input file route. We found the following example interesting.
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item The difference between OVERWRITE and INSERT. You can find the configuration files containing these two actions in the configuration gallery. However, we do not fully understand what happens to OVERWRITE when the tag does not exist and what\textquotesingle{}s the behaviour of INSERT when the tag exists. It would be great if you can find the answer through your own experiments.
\end{DoxyItemize}\hypertarget{Introduction_autotoc_md22}{}\doxysubsubsection{Step7\+: Polish documents.}\label{Introduction_autotoc_md22}
Once you\textquotesingle{}ve finished step 6, update your findings to the documents. All the documentation files are in {\ttfamily ./docs} directory, and we use d\+Oxygen to generate them. Have a look at the d\+Oxygen tutorials (webpage, Youtube, etc) and install d\+Oxygen on your local machine. Change directory to {\ttfamily /.docs} and type in {\ttfamily doxygen eciqc\+Dox\+Config}, the documents should be re-\/generated. Add your findings to {\ttfamily ./docs/doc\+\_\+pages/tutorial.md} and update the documents.\hypertarget{Introduction_autotoc_md23}{}\doxysubsubsection{Step8\+: (optimal) Understand presentation context and transfer syntax.}\label{Introduction_autotoc_md23}
\hypertarget{Introduction_autotoc_md24}{}\doxysubsubsection{Step9\+: End-\/to-\/\+End testing.}\label{Introduction_autotoc_md24}
In step 6 you should have understood how to specify your own configuration file and input images when running python scripts. This step is an extension. We are asking\+: given my configuration file and input image, does ECIQC behave as what I have expected? We can specify a configuration file list and input image list and test each pair. If all pairs work as expected, that will be great. If not, we need to go back to the parser source code and investigate the abnormal behaviours.

This part of work was conceptialised in February when we wrote {\ttfamily pipelinetest\+\_\+main.\+py}, but has never finished. You might find some old jupyter notebook files in the {\ttfamily i71-\/pipeline} useful.\hypertarget{Introduction_autotoc_md25}{}\doxysubsubsection{Step10\+: Python plug-\/in}\label{Introduction_autotoc_md25}
Adding Python plug-\/in will be a main focus of this year\textquotesingle{}s work. Last year, we spent the whole first week reading through the image segmentation and localisation, but did not have a chance to implement. If time permitted, you can find some papers and try to implement their algorithms. Also, think about the interface between C++ and Python plug-\/in. The Python plug-\/in should be added right after image-\/editor in the {\ttfamily Conductor\+::process\+\_\+dataset()} method.

That\textquotesingle{}s it! We hope you find this introduction useful, but you will be build your work (step 9 and 10) after reading this page. Feel free to ask any questions to Yiming or Martin, we are more than happy to help.
