ECIQC is a flexible framework for medical imaging quality control. Users can teach it what to do by writing configuration files. In this tutorial, we are going to introduce how to specify proper configuration files at successively increasing levels of details. This tutorial is suitable for both non-\/developers (end-\/users) and developers new to this software. At the end of this tutorial, you will learn
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item General syntaxes of configuration files;
\item How to modify the example configuration files to cater to users\textquotesingle{} needs;
\item How to start from strach to write proper configuration files.
\end{DoxyItemize}

Here are some common scenarios proposed by Chris from GE Healthcare. You can find the corresponding configuration codes in configuration gallery page.
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Case1\+: check whether the patient name is a 6-\/digit number. If so, insert the patient name to clinical trial subject id; reject otherwise.
\item Case2\+: check whether the clinical trial protocol id is 3 letters followed by 6 digits. If so, prepend the patient name with \char`\"{}\+\_\+\char`\"{} and clinical trial protocol id, reject otherwise.
\item Case3\+: check whether the date of birth is a 8-\/digit number. Replace the day with 30 and month with 06 if so.
\item Case4\+: check whether the modality is \textquotesingle{}MR\textquotesingle{}. If so, check whether the manufacturer is \textquotesingle{}SIEMENS\textquotesingle{} or \textquotesingle{}HITACHI\textquotesingle{}. If that\textquotesingle{}s true, check whether the magnetic field strenght equals 1.\+5 or 3.\+0. Set the clinical trial series description to T1 if all these conditions are satisfied; reject otherwise.

We recommend the readers to read through this tutorial and the configuration gallery for a better understanding.\+If you have any questions, please refer to FAQ page first. If not solved, please email to Yiming Wei(\href{mailto:yiming.wei@dtc.ox.ac.uk}{\texttt{ yiming.\+wei@dtc.\+ox.\+ac.\+uk}}) or Dr. Martin Robinson (\href{mailto:martin.robinson@dtc.ox.ac.uk}{\texttt{ martin.\+robinson@dtc.\+ox.\+ac.\+uk}}) for help.

 \hypertarget{Tutorials_autotoc_md40}{}\doxysubsubsection{Explanation}\label{Tutorials_autotoc_md40}
The ECIQC receives medical images via {\bfseries{receiver}} and sends post-\/processed images via {\bfseries{sender}}.The key {\ttfamily receiver} specifies the port number so that another remote sender can identify it and send proper images. The ECIQC pipeline checks the image and send normal images to the {\bfseries{destination}} and suspicious ones to the {\bfseries{quarantine}}. {\ttfamily Destination} and {\ttfamily quarantine} tell the ECIQC their addresses.

The key {\ttfamily metadata} is the main component of the configuration file. You will see long lines of code within this part. Typically, you will see one or more DICOM tags to work on(0010,0010), accompanied by the tag name (Patient Name),vr (data type and format) and a short line of description. The key {\ttfamily operations} inform the ECIQC what to do with this tag. You can guess with your gut instinct that this configuration file requires the pipeline to replace the name with Robert if the patient name is John Doe.\hypertarget{Tutorials_autotoc_md41}{}\doxysubsection{Receiver, Destination and Quarantine}\label{Tutorials_autotoc_md41}
As said before, {\ttfamily receiver} specifies the proper of the ECIQC receiver; {\ttfamily destination} tells the ECIQC where to send \char`\"{}good\char`\"{} images; {\ttfamily quarantine} provides the place to send \char`\"{}bad\char`\"{} images. You can use the local port for most test cases. However,if you are interested in communicating between different network nodes in real-\/world application (e.\+g. GE Healthcare), please ask your colleagues for more information.\hypertarget{Tutorials_autotoc_md42}{}\doxysubsection{Meta\+Data}\label{Tutorials_autotoc_md42}
The key {\ttfamily metadata} works on the metadata of a DICOM image.\+It usually comprises of one or more DICOM tags to work on. For full list of DICOM tags, please refer to the \href{https://www.dicomlibrary.com/dicom/dicom-tags/}{\texttt{ DICOM library}}. \hypertarget{Tutorials_autotoc_md43}{}\doxysubsubsection{Basic syntax within DICOM tags}\label{Tutorials_autotoc_md43}
Within each DICOM tag, you need to specify the {\ttfamily tag\+Name},{\ttfamily vr} and {\ttfamily description}. You can look up the {\ttfamily tag\+Name} and {\ttfamily vr} in the \href{https://www.dicomlibrary.com/dicom/dicom-tags/}{\texttt{ DICOM library}}. The {\ttfamily description} value is written by the user to enhace readibility. Then it comes to the key {\ttfamily operations}. \hypertarget{Tutorials_autotoc_md44}{}\doxysubsubsection{Operation types}\label{Tutorials_autotoc_md44}
There are typicall four types of operators.
\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item Comparison operators\+: EQUAL (==), GREATER\+\_\+\+THAN, LESS\+\_\+\+THAN,IS\+\_\+\+IN. These operators compare the tag value with the ones provided by the user. They are usually followed by {\ttfamily IF\+\_\+\+TRUE} and {\ttfamily IF\+\_\+\+FALSE}.
\item regular expression operators\+: EXIST, REGEX. These two operations check whether thare are specific \textquotesingle{}patterns\textquotesingle{} int he tag value, and return 3.\+Logical Operators\+: NOT, AND, ALL. These are similar to those used in programming languages and typically link multiple comparison operations and regular expression operations.
\item Actions\+: OVERWRITE,REMOVE,INSERT,CLEAR,COPY,UPDATE,APPEND,PREPEND,REJECT. Those are the real actions to perform if certain conditions are satisfied. The users can specify unconditional actions, which is not recommended in most cases.
\end{DoxyEnumerate}

We introduce the syntaxes of different operators in the following subsections. \hypertarget{Tutorials_autotoc_md45}{}\doxyparagraph{Comparison Operators ==,$<$=,$>$=,\textbackslash{}in}\label{Tutorials_autotoc_md45}
The basic syntax of comparison operators is 
\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{"{}operations"{}:\{}
\DoxyCodeLine{  "{}<comparison\_operator>"{}:\{}
\DoxyCodeLine{    "{}otherTagString"{}:"{}<other\_tag\_string>"{},}
\DoxyCodeLine{    "{}<value\_key>"{}:<compared\_value>,}
\DoxyCodeLine{    "{}IF\_TRUE"{}:\{<action\_clause>\},}
\DoxyCodeLine{    "{}IF\_FALSE"{}:\{<action\_clause>\}}
\DoxyCodeLine{  \}}
\DoxyCodeLine{\}}

\end{DoxyCode}
 where
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item \char`\"{}<comparison\+\_\+operator>\char`\"{}\+: EQUAL, GREATER\+\_\+\+THAN, LESS\+\_\+\+THAN, IS\+\_\+\+IN;
\item \char`\"{}<other\+\_\+tag\+\_\+string>\char`\"{}\+: tag for comparison; If specified as an empty string, the system will use the root tag;
\item \char`\"{}<value\+\_\+key>\char`\"{}\+: There\textquotesingle{}s a correspondence between $<$comparison\+\_\+operator$>$ and $<$value\+\_\+key$>$. \tabulinesep=1mm
\begin{longtabu}spread 0pt [c]{*{2}{|X[-1]}|}
\hline
\PBS\centering \cellcolor{\tableheadbgcolor}\textbf{ $<$comparison\+\_\+operator$>$   }&\PBS\centering \cellcolor{\tableheadbgcolor}\textbf{ $<$value\+\_\+key$>$    }\\\cline{1-2}

\PBS\centering IS\+\_\+\+IN   &\PBS\centering value\+List   \\\cline{1-2}
\end{longtabu}

\item $<$action\+\_\+clause$>$\+: actions to take (also could be nested operations), please refer to actions section.
\end{DoxyItemize}\hypertarget{Tutorials_autotoc_md46}{}\doxyparagraph{Regular expression}\label{Tutorials_autotoc_md46}
\hypertarget{Tutorials_autotoc_md47}{}\doxyparagraph{Logical Operators NOT, AND, ALL}\label{Tutorials_autotoc_md47}
Logical operators usually combine different comparison operators or regular expression operators. One typical syntax is\+: 
\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{"{}operations"{}:\{}
\DoxyCodeLine{  "{}<logical\_operator>"{}:\{}
\DoxyCodeLine{      "{}<comparison\_operator\_1>"{}:\{}
\DoxyCodeLine{        "{}otherTagString"{}:"{}<other\_tag\_string\_1>"{},}
\DoxyCodeLine{        "{}<value\_key\_1>"{}:<compared\_value\_1>,}
\DoxyCodeLine{      \},}
\DoxyCodeLine{      "{}<comparison\_operator\_2>"{}:\{}
\DoxyCodeLine{        "{}otherTagString"{}:"{}<other\_tag\_string\_2>"{},}
\DoxyCodeLine{        "{}<value\_key\_2>"{}:<compared\_value\_2>,}
\DoxyCodeLine{      \},}
\DoxyCodeLine{      "{}IF\_TRUE"{}:\{<action\_clause>\},}
\DoxyCodeLine{      "{}IF\_FALSE"{}:\{<action\_clause>\}}
\DoxyCodeLine{  \}}
\DoxyCodeLine{\}}

\end{DoxyCode}
 Remark\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item $<$logical\+\_\+operator$>$\+: {\ttfamily NOT}, {\ttfamily AND}, {\ttfamily OR}. {\ttfamily NOT} only permits one logical operator while {\ttfamily AND} and {\ttfamily OR} permits two or more.
\item If $<$comparison\+\_\+operator\+\_\+1$>$ and $<$comparison\+\_\+operator\+\_\+2$>$ are the same (e.\+g. EQUAL), use {\ttfamily EQUAL\+\_\+1} and {\ttfamily EQUAL\+\_\+2},etc. 
\end{DoxyItemize}\hypertarget{Tutorials_autotoc_md48}{}\doxyparagraph{Actions}\label{Tutorials_autotoc_md48}
Actions might be the most complicated part in the configurations. A wide variety of actions are enabled in the ECIQC, and many requires further specifications. The actions can be divided into several groups as follows.
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\bfseries{Group 1}}\+: UPDATE, INSERT, OVERWRITE
\item {\bfseries{Group 2}}\+: REMOVE, CLEAR REMOVE means
\item {\bfseries{Group 3}}\+: APPEND, PREPEND, APPEND means adding string at the end of the original value, while PREPEND means adding string at the start. Differetn from Group actions, the original tag value is presered in APPEND and PREPEND.
\item {\bfseries{Group 4}}\+: REJECT REJECT means putting the image to the quarantine.
\end{DoxyItemize}\hypertarget{Tutorials_autotoc_md49}{}\doxysubsubsection{Multiple operations}\label{Tutorials_autotoc_md49}
The users bump into multiple operations when multiple actions are needed. For example, you may want to prepend the patient name with a \textquotesingle{}\+\_\+\textquotesingle{}, and then copy the \textquotesingle{}\+\_\+patient\+\_\+name\textquotesingle{} to other tags. Also, users will naturally use multiple operations when logical operators are introduced. A typical instance is telling whether the tag value is in some range (AND, GREATER\+\_\+\+THAN lower bound, LESS\+\_\+\+THAN upper bound). The implementation of ECIQC naturally supports multiple operations as long as you put your desired order of actions correctly. However, you need to pay attention to the repeated keys issue. \hypertarget{Tutorials_autotoc_md50}{}\doxyparagraph{Repeated keys}\label{Tutorials_autotoc_md50}
A typical scenario for repeated keys is that you need to decide whether the tag value is {\ttfamily EQUAL} to valueA or valueB. One solution is to use the operation {\ttfamily IS\+\_\+in} and specify the comparison value to be a list. A more general approach is to prepend the {\ttfamily EQUAL} key with an unscore followed by some digits ({\ttfamily EQUAL\+\_\+1},{\ttfamily EQUAL\+\_\+2},...etc). The ECIQC will recognize them as different keys but behave in the same way as {\ttfamily EQUAL}.\hypertarget{Tutorials_autotoc_md51}{}\doxysubsubsection{Nested operations}\label{Tutorials_autotoc_md51}
The implementation of ECIQC also provides some flexibility for nested operations. A typical case would be\+: compare one tag to some value, and if the condition is true, you compare another tag with some other values and make further decision on your action. In this case, you need to nest the second comparison within {\ttfamily IF\+\_\+\+TRUE}/{\ttfamily IF\+\_\+\+FALSE} key in the first operation. In the second operation, you need to specify {\ttfamily other\+Tag\+String} if you work on a tag different from the first operation.\hypertarget{Tutorials_autotoc_md52}{}\doxysubsubsection{Miscellaneous}\label{Tutorials_autotoc_md52}
There is also some more details to introduce. Typically they involve multiple tags (e.\+g. copy value from one tag to another; the tag to be acted on are differnt from that in the logical conditions,etc). We recommend to ignore this first, and come back to the following details when you are stuck in some difficulities. Since this project is still in active developement, you can contact the authors for help. \hypertarget{Tutorials_autotoc_md53}{}\doxyparagraph{Operations cheat sheet}\label{Tutorials_autotoc_md53}
