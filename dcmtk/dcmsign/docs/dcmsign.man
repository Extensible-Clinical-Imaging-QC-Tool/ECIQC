\section synopsis SYNOPSIS

\verbatim
dcmsign [options] dcmfile-in [dcmfile-out]
\endverbatim

\section description DESCRIPTION

The \b dcmsign utility reads a DICOM file (\e dcmfile-in), performs a digital
signature operation and, if any modification has taken place, writes the DICOM
object to an output file (\e dcmfile-out).

Five digital signature operations are supported:

\li verification of all signatures in the DICOM file
\li creation of a new digital signature located in the main dataset,
\li creation of a new digital signature in an item of a sequence embedded
    within the dataset,
\li removal of a single digital signature from the DICOM file, and
\li removal of all digital signatures from the DICOM file.

\section parameters PARAMETERS

\section notes NOTES

\subsection files_and_parameters Files and Parameters

The \b dcmsign utility reads and writes a number of files and file formats
which are described in this section.

Public Key Certificates are expected in X.509v3 format, either with PEM or DER
encoding. The dcmsign utility currently supports RSA and DSA public keys,
although only RSA keys are defines in the Security Profiles of the DICOM
standard.

Private Keys are expected in PEM or DER encoding. PEM is recommended (and
default) because this allows one to keep private keys in encrypted form. Command
line options control the behavior of \b dcmsign when an encrypted PEM key is
opened (see above).  In general it is not recommended to specify the encryption
password in the command line because the command line may be visible to other
processes in the system, e.g. "ps -ef".

The list of data elements to sign can either be read from a file or specified
on the command line or both (in this case the keys are combined).

On the command line, attribute keys are specified as

\verbatim
--tag "gggg,eeee"  where gggg and eeee are the hexadecimal group
                   and element numbers
--tag "Name"       where 'Name' is a symbolic attribute name from
                   the DICOM dictionary (see below).
\endverbatim

When attribute tags are read from file with the \e --tag-file option, a plain
text file of max. 64 kbyte is expected.  Tags within the file are either
symbolic names from the data dictionary or have the format (gggg,eeee) (with
braces).  Tags are separated by one or more whitespace characters.

The \e --sign-item operation requires a location string that describes in which
sequence item a signature is to be created.  The location string has the
following format:

\verbatim
SequenceName[index].SequenceName[index].SequenceName[index](...)
\endverbatim

where SequenceName is either a symbolic attribute name from the data dictionary
or a numeric tag in the format (gggg,eeee) and index is an unsigned decimal
integer for the item number, starting with zero for the first item in a
sequence.  As an example, the following location string

\verbatim
ReferencedSeriesSequence[0].ReferencedImageSequence[1]
\endverbatim

would cause a digital signature to be created in the second item of the
ReferencedImageSequence (0008,1140) which is located in the first item of the
ReferencedSeriesSequence (0008,1115) which is located in the main DICOM
dataset.

\section logging LOGGING

The level of logging output of the various command line tools and underlying
libraries can be specified by the user.  By default, only errors and warnings
are written to the standard error stream.  Using option \e --verbose also
informational messages like processing details are reported.  Option
\e --debug can be used to get more details on the internal activity, e.g. for
debugging purposes.  Other logging levels can be selected using option
\e --log-level.  In \e --quiet mode only fatal errors are reported.  In such
very severe error events, the application will usually terminate.  For more
details on the different logging levels, see documentation of module "oflog".

In case the logging output should be written to file (optionally with logfile
rotation), to syslog (Unix) or the event log (Windows) option \e --log-config
can be used.  This configuration file also allows for directing only certain
messages to a particular output stream and for filtering certain messages
based on the module or application where they are generated.  An example
configuration file is provided in <em>\<etcdir\>/logger.cfg</em>.

\section command_line COMMAND LINE

All command line tools use the following notation for parameters: square
brackets enclose optional values (0-1), three trailing dots indicate that
multiple values are allowed (1-n), a combination of both means 0 to n values.

Command line options are distinguished from parameters by a leading '+' or '-'
sign, respectively.  Usually, order and position of command line options are
arbitrary (i.e. they can appear anywhere).  However, if options are mutually
exclusive the rightmost appearance is used.  This behavior conforms to the
standard evaluation rules of common Unix shells.

In addition, one or more command files can be specified using an '@' sign as a
prefix to the filename (e.g. <em>\@command.txt</em>).  Such a command argument
is replaced by the content of the corresponding text file (multiple
whitespaces are treated as a single separator unless they appear between two
quotation marks) prior to any further evaluation.  Please note that a command
file cannot contain another command file.  This simple but effective approach
allows one to summarize common combinations of options/parameters and avoids
longish and confusing command lines (an example is provided in file
<em>\<datadir\>/dumppat.txt</em>).

\section environment ENVIRONMENT

The \b dcmsign utility will attempt to load DICOM data dictionaries specified
in the \e DCMDICTPATH environment variable.  By default, i.e. if the
\e DCMDICTPATH environment variable is not set, the file
<em>\<datadir\>/dicom.dic</em> will be loaded unless the dictionary is built
into the application (default for Windows).

The default behavior should be preferred and the \e DCMDICTPATH environment
variable only used when alternative data dictionaries are required.  The
\e DCMDICTPATH environment variable has the same format as the Unix shell
\e PATH variable in that a colon (":") separates entries.  On Windows systems,
a semicolon (";") is used as a separator.  The data dictionary code will
attempt to load each file specified in the \e DCMDICTPATH environment variable.
It is an error if no data dictionary can be loaded.
